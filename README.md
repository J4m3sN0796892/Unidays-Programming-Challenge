# Unidays-Programming-Challenge
My solution to the Unidays Pragramming Challenge

My program is written in Python and in order to run it you need to download python. (https://www.python.org/downloads/)
The envoirment i used to code in was Idle 3.7.

The way i went about coding the program was to use classes and functions to do the main aspects of the program as i could pass values in
and return a single value out for each function. This was the cleanest way i could find to do it.

In Terms of how i applied the discount i created a counter for each letter and then at the end of the loop pass each counter to a function
in the pricing rules class which applies the logic using the remainder and Mod opperators in python.

I saved the contents of the Basket in a list as i could easily index the contenets of a list. This is also the same reason i used a dictionary
to save the letters and their corresponding values as if a letter's value changed it would be easy to update.
